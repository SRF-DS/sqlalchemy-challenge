# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this project I used my standard combination of ai tools.

However in this assignment I used the Xpert Learning Assistant from canvas far more.

I realized that starting from copy pastes from solved Module 10 assignments was super helpful.
To build on that while keeping me honest Xpert Learning assistant is a valuable guide to determining if the use case of the code blocks was effective according to it's logic.

I also found it to be instructive in a way that allowed me to keep my code dense without fluff.
Since it didn't give hardly anything that function it was in a way like mad libs except with coding concepts but applicable knoweldge that we are intended to use to solve the project.

I wanted to have a firmer understanding of using SQL and API creation so this was the method I used to better learn. However it is simply part of my MO to use perplexity.
So as I completed code sections I would ask it to spiff it up change printed text into labeled data frames for more beautiful presentation of my code.

You can see that in multiple instances I really tried to go the extra mile presentaiton wise for this project and I hope that can be considered. Using pandas was fairly simple enough really the struggle was using SQL alchemy to create SQL queries. 

I found this project compelling and increases my confidence as a anaylst / developer.
